MYNOTES: what to change

change title, there is still alns in there.

exchange s and t is figure 9 with source and sink.
Furthermore, change blue lines of opening times to black lines

is it OPT_TTRP or TTRP_OPT or $TTRP_OPT$ (like in symbol table). SHould it even be done with capital letters??

Things left to write: finish tt intro. , change figure event split. 

Fuck intro figures to TT. Just send it for review. If unclear you can always add. 

Turn every entry in symbol table to sentence with capital letter and dot at end. COnsistent

tau^{start/end} --> tau^{open/close}

v^{\rm source}  -> source. Because v^{\rm end} is function of v. 
hence inconsistent notation. 

page 4 alns -> vns

figure 1 remove lines

remove a few lines from abstract. 

1.4 remove note

Rmemove the retorical questions from 2.2 problem mdoel

Check the last email efraim sent for any remaining feedback

2.1 add \\'s

remove play and end from figure 8 for consistency.

introduce in figure 9 also super source icon and supersink icon

Explicitly mention that the Depot is the supersink for the load. 

ctrl f for FIXME or TODO

make figure for tt simpler Just name if precedence graph, also capacity graph in lt. 
Just split every event in two. 

Consider puttign the synthetic trailer in a table like the one in section 4. To clarify

In appendix of symbols add sets. thus lorry k must be lorry k \in F^lorry

remove 3 rhetorical questions from load table intro.

references after appendix

separate appenix a b c1 c2 for differnt sections

i,j must often become u,v

decide where to put intro to vrpttmu. btw, also in intro chpater 1?

alns must become vns

If I move definition of X Y and T L and to objective function section it is more
convenient to make of t-path duriaton a function and also write the costf unctions as 
such. just as U: penalty is.

Conclusions should not be written in past tense.

N for neighborhood set is very confusing. hence remove from algo subsection

Explicitly state that I extended it to also include time costs. 



C^step-one must become mapping DURATION . THis mapping is symmetric!!!
 furhermore, there is only one set of vertices
, hence remove step one, but make V^precedence. 
perhaps make from E^step-one -> E^forward

subsection vertices -> vertices and vertex parameters

startVisitation must be latestPossibleVisistationStart. This is true. Change 
description of assumption that lorries leave immediatley after ending visit. 

Construct the time table not using backward sweep but building up from start times. 

end of time window --> vertex' closing time. also cahnge in parameter definition

former 2 points: decide: is part of vrptt that lorry leaves as early as possible as does 
visit as earl yas possible. means i have to do third forward sweep. Decision waas made.
Now be clear that part of vrptt is that lorry depart as early as possible. 

(u,v,) \in {(u',v'):  ...

Stil change 2.2. instance consist of tuple.. .

XY -> path assignment (X,Y)

#####DONE ########

DONE remove \ell


DONE check out contributions.txt

DONE what about to early?? i.e. too early serving. This would tranaslate to  arriving at
the next vertex too early. Is this a separate constraint? how to resolve penalty ?
no penalty for too early, just not feasible solution

############
# DO LATER AFTER I GET THE OKAY, perhaps
############

Remove references to alns?

describe vns more in abstact terms, repeatedly using differnet neighboorhoods to get new solutions.

decide whether to include simple example figure in vrptt section of problem 
that would use trailer sharing and profit from it. 
If so uncomment a line about it in conclusion
Show that with short time window the multiple unload does not give reduced costs. 
It is always cheaper to let one vehicle do everything. 
In normal situation this is not possibe within time horizon therefore 
you have multiple lorries. So assume not enough time for 1 lorry and 1 trailer to do everything
?? not sure for which conditions this holds:
that you have a bounded fleet and without trailer sharing you just cant do it.
