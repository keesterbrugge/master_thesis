\begin{abstract}
The vehicle routing problem with trailers and transshipments (VRPTT) generalizes the truck and trailer routing problem (TTRP) such that a single trailer can be shared by multiple lorries.
% The VRPTT is useful to model vehicle routing problems in which synchronization and optionality plays a significant role.
A simpler representation of load transfers has been formulated for the VRPTT.
% The VRPTT has been reformulated simpler without losing generality.
A variable neighborhood heuristic (VNS) has been developed that finds results close to the upper bounds of all instances with up to eight customers within minutes.
The results of the VNS for the VRPTT are the first that include the time related costs of a solution, which allows for a comparison with results for the TTRP on these instances.
The comparison suggest that these instances are not a good choice for showing the benefits of trailers sharing, since trailer sharing was not used in any of the best solutions found by the VNS.
An extension was made to the model which allows lorries to take multiple trips during one planning horizon.
 % which leads to significant cost reductions on many instances.
This extension resulted in significant cost reductions on many instances.
